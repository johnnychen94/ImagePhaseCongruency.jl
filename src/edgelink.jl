edgelink - Link edge points in an image into lists
```
Usage: (edgeList edgeimg, edgeType) = edgelink(img; location=nothing)

Arguments:  img        - Binary edge image, it is assumed that edges
                         have been thinned (or are nearly thin).
            location   - Optional complex valued image holding subpixel
                         locations of edge points. For any pixel the
                         real part holds the subpixel row coordinate of
                         that edge point and the imaginary part holds
                         the column coordinate.  See nonmaxsup().  If
                         this argument is supplied the edgelists will
                         be formed from the subpixel coordinates,
                         otherwise the the integer pixel coordinates of
                         points in 'img' are used.

Returns:  edgelist - Array of edge coordinate lists where each edgelist is an
                     2xN array of (x,y)/(col, row) coords in the form

                    [ [c1 c2 ...
                       r1 r2 ....]
                        .
                        .
                        .
                      [c1 c2 ...
                       r1 r2 ....] ]

         edgeimg   - Image with pixels labeled with edge number.
                     Note that junctions in the labeled edge image will be
                     labeled with the edge number of the last edge that was
                     tracked through it.

        edgeType   - Array of values, one for each edge segment indicating
                     its type
                     0  - Start free, end free
                     1  - Start free, end junction
                     2  - Start junction, end free (should not happen)
                     3  - Start junction, end junction
                     4  - Loop
```
This function links edge points together into lists of coordinate pairs.
Where an edge junction is encountered the list is terminated and a separate
list is generated for each of the branches.

trackedge

Function to track all the edge points starting from an end point or junction.
As it tracks it stores the coords of the edge points in an array and labels the
pixels in the edge image with the -ve of their edge number. This continues
until no more connected points are found, or a junction point is encountered.
```
Usage:   edgepoints = trackedge(rstart, cstart, edgeNo, r2, c2, avoidJunction)

Arguments:   rstart, cstart   - Row and column No of starting point.
             edgeNo           - The current edge number.
             r2, c2           - Optional row and column coords of 2nd point.
             avoidJunction    - Optional flag indicating that (r2,c2)
                                should not be immediately connected to a
                                junction (if possible).

Returns:     edgepoints       - Nx2 array of row and col values for
                                each edge point.

lineseg - Form straight line segements from an edge list.
```
Usage: seglist = lineseg(edgelist, tol)

Arguments:  edgelist - Array of edgelists where each edgelist is an
                       2xN array of (x,y)/(col, row) coords. For example,
                       as produced by edgelink()
            tol      - Maximum deviation from straight line before a
                       segment is broken in two (measured in pixels).
Returns:
            seglist  - An array in the same format of the input
                       edgelist but each seglist is a subsampling of its
                       corresponding edgelist such that straight line
                       segments between these subsampled points do not
                       deviate from the original points by more than tol.
```
This function takes each array of edgepoints in edgelist, finds the
size and position of the maximum deviation from the line that joins the
endpoints, if the maximum deviation exceeds the allowable tolerance the
edge is shortened to the point of maximum deviation and the test is
repeated.  In this manner each edge is broken down to line segments,
each of which adhere to the original data with the specified tolerance.

filledgegaps -  Fills small gaps in a binary edge map image
```
Usage: bw2 = filledgegaps(bw, gapsize)

Arguments:    bw - Binary edge image
         gapsize - The edge gap size that you wish to be able to fill.
                   Use the smallest value you can. (Odd values work best).

Returns:     bw2 - The binary edge image with gaps filled.
```

Strategy: A binary circular blob of radius = gapsize/2 is placed at the end of
every edge segment.  If the ends of two edge segments are in close proximity
the circular blobs will overlap.  The image is then thinned.  Where circular
blobs at end points overlap the thinning process will leave behind a line of
pixels linking the two end points.  Where an end point is isolated the
thinning process will erode the circular blob away so that the original edge
segment is restored.

Use the smallest gapsize value you can.  With large values all sorts of
unwelcome linking can occur.

The circular blobs are generated using the function CIRCULARSTRUCT which,
unlike MATLAB's STREL, will accept real valued radius values.  Note that I
suggest that you use an odd value for 'gapsize'.  This results in a radius
value of the form x.5 being passed to CIRCULARSTRUCT which results in discrete
approximation to a circle that seems to respond to thinning in a 'good'
way. With integer radius values CIRCULARSTRUCT can produce circles that
result in minor artifacts being generated by the thinning process.
